# DMS Software Architect Handbook
This handbook defines the responsibilities associated with the DMS Software Architect role and the current methods used to meet the responsibilities.

# Responsibilities
## Architecture and Design
* With stakeholder groups, help clarify requirements and technical success criteria for software development.
* As a member of the architecture team, define architecture for projects which span applications and organizational boundaries.
* Recognize and/or define boundaries and interfaces between components to create working applications and a maintainable development path.
* Work across teams to advance a unified framework for the user-facing tools.
* Ensure critical documentation is delivered.
## Technical Management
* With DMS management, help define consistent standards for technologies across the observatory, balancing re-use of tools and software across the observatory with strategic exploration of new tools.
## Technical Development
* Prototype solutions for new applications and new approaches to existing applications.

# Methods
## Architecture and Design
The general approach for addressing architecture and design responsibilities involves:
* analyzing business requirements to extract and define the most significant architectural requirements (“-ilities”)(ASRs) 
* selecting architecture patterns and styles which fit the problem domain and address ASRs
* creating the building blocks of the system 

This approach happens in collaboration with the product stakeholders and the development team. Using the general approach, the DMS software architect supports the development team in generating the detailed design and implementing the product.

## Technical Management
A technology inventory is used to organize and manage languages, frameworks, tools, platforms, and techniques across DMS. All items in the inventory are further organized by their adoption lifecycle state. Details about the inventory can be found [here](https://github.com/whiteheaddmark/Technology-Inventory).

## Technical Development
